# Semi-supervised-Network
A semi-supervised neural network which is based on the paper **Semi-Supervised Learning with Ladder Networks**.
The sturctrue of this deep neural network combines supervised learning with unsupervised learning, and it is trained to simultaneously minimize the sum of supervised and unsupervised cost functions by backpropagation.In fact, the unsupervised learing complement supervised learing mission to get a better result.
